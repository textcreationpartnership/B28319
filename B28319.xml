            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PRESENT CASE OF Our English Wool, And the MANUFACTURE of it, Humbly offered to the Consideration of the PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>THat our English Wool, and the Manufacture of it, for these many Ages past, hath not only been the Wealth and Publick Stock of our Kingdom, but the chief and principal Support and Maintenance of our Trade and Commerce with all our neighbouring Kingdoms and States, we need not here make it any part of this to prove; the present decay thereof, both in the low price of our Wool at home, and in the sinking of our English Cloath-trade abroad, give us sufficient experience of this truth.</p>
            <p>What Care and Industry hath been used by our Kings and Parliaments in former Ages, to preserve and encourage this Woollen Manufacture of our own growth, and to engross it wholly within the bounds of our own Nation, for the employing of our Poor, and for the furnishing us with such a Staple-Commodity which should enable us by the return thereof to bear up a Trade with other parts of the world for their Commodities which we wanted, without exhausting our Money, the several Acts and Statutes of Parliament made in the Reigns of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> may sufficiently inform us: And no question, had not the late unhappy and destructive VVar (the onely Cause of this and all other Miseries the Nation at this day can complain of) broken out upon us, there would doubtless have been the same (if not greater) care taken for the Preservation of this Trade, in all our later Parliaments; and not have suffered it thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably to be abused both in the Making and Selling of our Cloath. The engrossing whereof into the hands of a few private persons (called Factors) set up in the late Rebellion at <hi>Blackwell-hall,</hi> adds much to the hindring and decaying of this our Trade, by the want of that Freedom our Clothiers in all former times ever had to Dispose and Sell their own Cloath themselves. The Complaints of those, with what may be the Causes of the low price of our VVool, the which is more largely discours'd in some few sheets, called <hi>A Treatise of Wool and Cattel,</hi> is humbly offered to the Judgment and Consideration of this present Parliament, the onely High Court before whom this Case can come for Redress.</p>
            <p>There can be no greater or more prevailing Argument used to beg your Care of this great Business, than to minde you of the industry and diligence of your Predecessors in all former Parliaments ever since the Manufacture became our own, to preserve it to our selves; and of what an unvaluable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern they ever lookt upon it to be to the Interest and Trade of this Kingdom, that the endeavouring the Abuse of it in some Cases hath been made Felony.</p>
            <p>But if to encourage your zeal herein, we should offer to your Consideration, how much your private, and every Members particular Concern is linkt even to this very Trade, and that the low price of our Wool (as at this day) makes your Rents come in so slow, and some perhaps not at all, and brings all the Lands and Estates of the Kingdom concern'd therein, to a far less Value now than they were at when this Trade had an encouragement, and was in Reputation in the world.</p>
            <p>VVe cannot but hope we shall yet, by your great VVisdom and Prudence, live to see the same restored to its ancient Credit and Esteem again; and to have your chief and principal Care for its Increase and Advancement, as well by removing all Causes of its decay on the one hand, and by promoting the general Use and VVearing of our own Cloath, and spending of our VVool among our selves, on the other; as by improving those present opportunities we have at this day with our Neighbours (more than possibly we may meet with at another time if this be omitted) to advance this VVoollen-trade, by procuring that part of the Manufacture thereof now abroad, to return to its natural Soil, where for these many Ages past it hath onely flourish'd, and hath been the great business and employment for our People, the Staple-Commodity of our Nation, and the chief and principal Support of our Trade.</p>
            <p>The Reasons of the Low price of our VVool, and Decay of this Trade, will be humbly offered to that Committee your VVisdoms shall appoint to examine it.</p>
